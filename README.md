# MyWork
Here is a repository of some of the code and projects I have worked on in the last few years. This will include but not limited to HTML, Python, Java, Javascript, CSS and PHP. Each file will be briefly explained below.

## Carbon Aware Big Data Job Sceduler
**Python, pyspark**
This implementation is a carbon aware scheduler that can be deployed on a cluster, which successfully reduces the carbon footprint of jobs submitted. This is the source code for my fourth-year project at the University of Glasgow, all relevant information can be found within the repository.

## Monopoly
**Java**
This was my 6th year project in high school, I created a two-player version of monopoly with a fully functional user interface in Java. The interface displays the players current position, balance, dice, and balance. The interface had buttons for all the miscellaneous actions in Monopoly such as buying property, rolling dice and ending your turn.

## Parasites Web Application
**Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
My team project for third year university, here we created a website for the Institute of Infections, Immunity & Inflammation. The website allowed users to upload content about research and comment on each otherâ€™s work. The website also featured a user rank hierarchy which would allow different user levels different permissions and rights to manage other users and content.

## Suffix Tree Algorithms
**Java**
In this program I tackle many different algorithms for investigating the properties of suffix trees. More information about each of the methods can be found in the status report in the repository.

## Multithreaded Dependency Discoverer
**C**
This program experiments with different numbers of threads for crawling C files for dependencies, it delves into the benefits and limitations of parallelism. There is a status report pdf in this file with all the relevant information.

## Promela Load Balancing Protocol
**Promela**
Here I created a load balancer protocol model which can process four client processes with different states. The balance is maintained by ensuring each client keeps a balanced load with their neighbours. There is a report pdf in this file with all the relevant information.

## FunExtended
**Java, Fun**

Here I extended the provided Fun programming language to be able to process for and switch control flow statements. This involved creating the relevant tokenizer, parser and code generators. There is a status report pdf in this file with all the relevant information. 

## Turtle Graphics
**Haskell**

This is a language parser created using the functional programming language Haskell, the programs will process commands which order the turtle to draw shapes. This is done via the processing of rotation angles and distances all relevant to the current position of the turtle and whether the pen is down or up.

## Tango with Django
**Python, HTML, CSS**
In this project I learned how to create web applications, manage their content and user authentication. Also how to create website themes using CSS and HTML skeleton/base pages and populating the website using a python script for testing. Overall, during this exercise, I learned about web applications and how to manage them and improve their usability.
